# Building
yarn run prod

### Update 12/06/2021
I'm surprised this still works lol. God this desperately needs a rewrite 

### TODO:
- ~~Add queueing to prevent overloading torrent server~~
- ~~Only write to disk on close~~
- ~~Add clickable links to view file in 'explorer'~~
- ~~Add a download tab after finished~~
- ~~File browser~~
- ~~Port to server side application so webhook can connect over a VPS~~ **N/A Browser will still connect locally**
